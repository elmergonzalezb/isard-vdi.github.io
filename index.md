### Welcome to Isard VDI
Isard Virtual Desktops Infraestructure has been developed for education from the education point of view. Coded and tested by two teachers it aims to provide fast creation of desktops from base Operating Systems like Windows or Linux. The core of the Isard application will provide and user friendly and easy interface where students and teachers can create and connect to their virtual desktops in a few seconds, thus providing an agile system in teaching environments.

Teachers can create their desktop, install the software they are going to use with their students and convert it to a new template. Their students can immediately create desktops identical to those templates and start using it. 

When class finishes, the teacher can create another template from his desktop so, students that couldn’t reach the class goals will be able to create new desktop from this new teacher’s template in next class. This leverages the teaching to another stage!

### Key benefits in class
+ Teacher can deploy apps and exercises to their students in no time.
+ Class is not tidied to a room as the desktops can run anywhere.
+ Forgive about repairing failed operating systems or apps, just create new desktops from templates.
+ Remote access to desktops available through Internet bandwidth connection.

### Background
The complete Isard system has been tested with cents of users and cents of desktops in our +2500 students school.

Currently we have +1200 desktops and templates created by teachers and students in less than 5TB hard disks, thanks to our snapshot templating system.

Our backend storage system was build with low end commercial components and we took the tuning to the limits. Keeping costs as low as possible was our main requirement.

Highy reliable system based on a PaceMaker cluster, with a high performant storage that gives us +350Kiops to handle simultaneous writes.

### Technical details
+ Fast deployment of new desktops based on templating.
+ Open Source user interface and backplane orquestration engine
+ Using open source qemu and libvirt virtualization on backplane
+ Lightweight app with quick user interface
+ Hypervisor balancing engine
+ Encrypted TLS connections to viewers
+ Transparently plug of remote usb devices
+ User local and OpenLdap authentications
