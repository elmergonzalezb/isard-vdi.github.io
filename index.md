# Isard VDI
IsardVDI was born with the goal of creating a free software alternative to solutions such as Citrix XenDesktops or VMware Horizon in deploying virtual desktops.

IsardVDI directly manages KVM Linux hypervisors using libvirt.

A web application allows agile deployments of desktops and manage hypervisors.
