# Isard**VDI**
Isard**VDI** was born with the aim of creating a free software alternative to privative virtual desktops solutions such as Citrix XenDesktops or VMware Horizon.

Isard**VDI** directly manages KVM Linux hypervisors using libvirt.

A web application allows agile desktop deployments and centralized hypervisors management.

Use only for testing purposes. Work in progress.

#### Release notes:

2016-02-26: v0.1 First Beta Release 

#### Future lines and roadmap

We are currently developing new features and continuosly testing it in a real production environtment.
Remote organization access and intensive 3D rendering (among other features) are being tested.

#### Success story

Our organization bet two years ago for our proposal to implement a system of virtual desks. We evaluated the existing systems in the market and verified that they were not perfectly adapted to the educational environment.

It was then when we created a proof of concept with KVM in linux that turned out to be successful.

In September of 2015 we managed to put into operation a first version of the software with an infrastructure fully assembled and optimized by us, since the costs had to be extremely reduced compared to the existing commercial systems.

Teachers and students soon adopted this solution as it provided them with a greater degree of autonomy and agility. Only with the mouth-ear we manage to reach the spectacular numbers of use that we have in our organization.

+ Our current production environtment has more than 800 users and 1400 virtual desktops. 
+ We have teachers and students using it in a day basis seamlesly in classrooms around buildings.
+ We managed to maintain a very low costs

In 2016 we focused all our efforts on a solid and versatile software that materialized in IsardVDI, a software thought from the requirements of the educational system.
